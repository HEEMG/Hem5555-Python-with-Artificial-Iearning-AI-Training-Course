Maoist leader Barsha Man Pun had even claimed that a coalition government of NC, JSP and Maoist Center will be formed after JSP\\'s meeting on Thursday but the party postponed the meeting citing lack of preparations.JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav said time has yet to ripen for formation of the new government. \"We will stand against regressive forces like Oli,\" Yadav told reporters after the meeting was called off. \"We cannot tie the knot with Oli. Situation has also not yet matured. Cooperation with Oli would be betrayal of the Madhes movement.\"He claimed that continuation of Oli as PM would help revocation of federalism.Another JSP leader told Setopati that the party has held discussion with Oli, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and demanded Constitution amendment and withdrawal of cases against the party leaders and cadres. The leader claimed that neither Oli nor Deuba have expressed solid commitment to fulfill the party\\'s demands.JSP seems to be divided on the issue of joining the government with a few including Chairman Mahantha Thakur claiming that the party can move forward helping Oli while Yadav and Baburam Bhattarai are adamant about forming a government excluding Oli.\"Those who say we should ally with Oli have yet to submit solid commitments from Oli on our demands,\" another JSP leader revealed. \"Those who say we should form government under Deuba or excluding Oli also have not been able to present a roadmap for fulfilling our demands. Why should we hold central executive committee meeting in such situation? Preparation was not enough, it has been called off.\"The leader stated that Deuba does not seem eager to forge a new alliance while Oli has refused to withdraw cases against JSP leaders and cadres despite the party negotiating with CPN-UML forming a task force.Some in JSP are saying that the party should lead the next government but it has yet to prepare parliamentary party statute and elect parliamentary party leader. \"There was informal agreement to make Rajendra Mahato the parliamentary party leader before unification of Rashtriya Janata Party and Federal Socialist Party,\" the leader claimed. \"Upendra Yadav has commented that he is unaware about that agreement. Who will be parliamentary party leader is yet to be known.\"There are also some who say the parliamentary party leader should not lead the party in the government if JSP doesn\\'t get to lead the government.JSP currently has 32 House of Representatives (HoR) members with Resham Chaudhary jailed and Hari Narayan Chaudhary suspended. NC, which had won 63 seats, has 61 members with Bijay Kumar Gachchhadar suspended and Mohammad Aftab Alam jailed. Maoist Center has 48 lawmakers.The three parties together can form government excluding Oli who says he is ready to face no-confidence motion in the House.UML can form government with support of JSP or even a faction of the party if it were to split over joining the government.',\n",

              " 'North Korea said Thursday it will ignore a U.S. offer for talks unless it withdraws its hostile policy, after Washington reached out to Pyongyang in a bid to resume nuclear negotiations.The statement by Choe Son Hui, the first foreign minister, came hours before the U.S. and South Korean foreign and defense chiefs met in Seoul for their first joint talks in five years to discuss North Korea’s nuclear program.“What has been heard from the U.S. since the emergence of the new regime is only a lunatic theory of ‘threat from North Korea’ and groundless rhetoric about ‘complete denuclearization,’” Choe said, calling the offer for talks a “time-delaying trick.”He reiterated North Korea’s position that no “dialogue of any kind” can be possible unless the U.S. rolls back its hostility. “Therefore, we will disregard such an attempt of the U.S. in the future, too.”U.S.-led diplomacy focusing on North Korea’s nuclear weapons remains stalemated for about two years because of disputes over U.S.-led sanctions. Experts are debating whether the United States and its allies should settle for a deal that would freeze North Korea’s nuclear activities in return for relaxing sanctions to prevent its arsenal from growing.Earlier this week, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to abandon rapprochement with South Korea and warned the United States to “refrain from causing a stink,” while criticizing regular U.S.-South Korean military drills that her government views as an invasion rehearsal.Choe again took issue with this month’s drills, saying that the United States “openly started aggression-minded joint military exercises targeting us.”Some experts say North Korea, which is eager to win sanctions relief, may further raise animosities with missile tests to boost its leverage in any negotiations with the United States. North Korea’s moribund economy is under additional pressure because of the pandemic-related border closure that has significantly shrunk its external trade and a spate of natural disasters last summer.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a visit to Tokyo earlier this week that Washington had reached out to North Korea through several channels, including in New York, starting in mid-February, but it hasn’t received any response. He said the Biden administration was looking forward to completing its policy review on North Korea in coming weeks and was looking both at possible “additional pressure measures” and “diplomatic paths.”When Blinken met South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong on Wednesday, he said the United States will work with allies to achieve the denuclearization of North Korea and criticized what he called North Korea’s “systematic and widespread abuses against its own people.” According to the State Department, Blinken and Chung also reaffirmed a shared commitment to address North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile issues that they said are “a priority for the alliance.”Choe said U.S. attempts to contact North Korea included emails and telephone messages via various channels. She said that even on the eve of its drills with South Korea, Washington sent a message “imploring us to respond to its request through a third country.”Choe said it will “only be a waste of time to sit with the U.S.”Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are on the first overseas trip by Cabinet-level officials since President Joe Biden took office in January. Biden is pushing to restore alliances that were frayed under his predecessor Donald Trump’s “America First” approach and bolster a U.S. leadership on the world stage in the face of growing challenges from China.Other likely topics during Thursday’s talks in Seoul include a U.S. desire to resolve historical disputes between Seoul and Tokyo and boost a U.S.-led trilateral cooperation, and South Korea possibly joining an expanded format of the Indo-Pacific group that involves the United States, Japan, Australia and India known as the Quad.',\n",

He also urged the gathering to beware of the cyber cell employed by Oli to propagate disinformation. \"Beware of cyber foxes. They can disseminate wrong information. Don\\'t remain in any kind of confusion.\"Speaking before Nepal, Jhala Nath Khanal accused Oli of starting factionalism in the party through Madan Bhandari Foundation and blamed him for all the recent problems in the party. He also accused PM Oli of protecting corrupt persons in the past three years and appointing only blind followers to important positions. \\xa0\\xa0He reminded how Oli unilaterally brought controversial ordinances without consulting the party and did not even call party meetings in recent times.

              " 'At least two people protesting last month’s military coup were reported shot and killed by Myanmar security forces Tuesday after a morning of peaceful marches.Security forces have killed scores of their countrymen in recent days, and the U.N. has put the death toll at 149 since the Feb. 1 coup that toppled Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government.The independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said 183 people have been killed since the coup.Violence was reported Tuesday in the biggest city, Yangon, where casualties have been the highest. Police fired rubber bullets in several neighborhoods, and one man was reported killed. Another killing was reported in Kawlin city in the northwestern Sagaing Region.U.N. Human Rights Office spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, said at least 11 people were killed Monday, adding to 57 deaths over the weekend. While there were many more reports of killings, it was unable to corroborate them.“The killing of demonstrators, arbitrary arrests and the reported torture of prisoners violate fundamental human rights and stand in clear defiance of calls by the Security Council for restraint, dialogue and a return to Myanmar’s democratic path,” said U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions.Protesters have recently used tactics meant to avoid violent confrontations. On Tuesday, social media reports said candlelight marches before sunrise were held in Mawlamyaing in Mon State in southeastern Myanmar.Another tactic has been to use signboards as proxies for human protesters, placing them in rows in public places. This tactic was reported to have been used by a group of engineers in the second-biggest city, Mandalay, in central Myanmar.More conventional peaceful protests of the sort that have been occurring daily were held without incident Tuesday in Monywa and Ye-U in central Myanmar, the city of Loikaw in the eastern state of Kayaw, and Kalaw in Southern Shan State, also in the east.Complicating efforts to organize new protests as well as media coverage, cellphone internet service was cut Sunday night, although access was still available through fixed broadband connections.Mobile data service had been used to stream live video coverage of protests, often showing security forces attacking demonstrators. It previously had been turned off only from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. for several weeks, with no official explanation.Sunday’s violence in Yangon — virtually all by police — led to the greatest single-day death toll since the coup. Myanmar’s ruling junta declared martial law in a large part of the city.The martial law announcements said the junta, formally called the State Administrative Council, acted to enhance security and restore law and order, and that the Yangon regional commander has been entrusted with administrative, judicial and military powers in the area under his command. The orders cover six of Yangon’s 33 townships.The greatest violence and most deaths were reported in Yangon’s Hlaing Thar Yar township, an industrial area of many factories that supply the garment industry, a major export earner for Myanmar. Several factories, many of which are Chinese-owned, were set ablaze Sunday by unknown parties, provoking the ire of Beijing.Thousands of the township’s residents in cars, taxis, pickup trucks, on motorcycles and on foot jammed roads out of the area Tuesday. Some sought safety, while others no longer have jobs.Protesters in the past week have responded to increased police violence by taking a more aggressive approach to self-defense, burning tires at barricades and pushing back when they can against attacks.The Committee Representing Pyihtaungsu Hluttaw, comprising elected members of Parliament who were not allowed to take their seats, said Sunday the general public has the legal right to self-defense against security forces.The CRPH, which operates underground inside the country and with representatives abroad, has established itself as a shadow government that claims to be the sole legitimate representative body of Myanmar’s citizens. It has been declared an illegal treasonous organization by the junta.State television MRTV announced Tuesday evening that a leading figure in the CRPH, known as Dr. Sasa, was charged with high treason, which carries a death sentence.Sasa, a medical doctor who uses a single name, is a member of the Chin ethnic minority and was appointed a special U.N. envoy by the CRPH, is accused of stirring up internal conflict and acting against the junta, which claims to be the sole legitimate ruling body despite having ousted an elected government.Sasa said he was proud to be charged with treason, “because treason against the junta means that I am standing with the people of Myanmar, giving my life for their freedom, for federal democracy and for justice.”His statement, dated Tuesday and duplicated on his Facebook page, recounted the Myanmar military’s long history of committing atrocities against ethnic minorities and putting down past protest movements, as well as the killings of civilians following last month’s coup.“It is these Generals that have committed acts of treason every day. Taking what they want for themselves, denying the people their rights, and oppressing those that stand in their way,” Sasa said.Sasa is the public face of the Myanmar resistance in the international arena, even though he reportedly is in hiding. He has spoken frequently with international media by video conference. He also has connected by video with foreign diplomats, U.N. officials and other junta opponents, including members of ethnic minorities who maintain their own guerrilla armies.The state-owned Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported that junta chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing told colleagues the protests have turned into “riots and violence.”Speaking at a Monday meeting of the junta in the capital, Naypyitaw, Min Aung Hlaing was quoted as saying the military was aiding police “as rearguards in required places to solve the difficulties and obstacles.”“Although there have been fewer protests, violent acts emerged in some areas, such as burning public property and factories. So, security forces had to handle the situation very hard,” according to the account. “The protesters raided police stations and administrative offices and burned factories. Meanwhile, the shooting had to disperse the protesters, resulting in some security forces and protesters’ casualties.”Virtually all independent accounts blame security forces for initiating violence against unarmed protesters.Many protesters have called for foreign intervention to aid them under the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect — R2P — devised to deal with matters such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.The U.N. and other regional bodies and nations have urged measures to reconcile the protesters and military and an end to violence. Several Western nations applied sanctions against the generals and their business connections, but the junta is confident it can withstand the pressure, especially with China as a diplomatic ally who can block coordinated U.N. action and make up shortfalls in aid and investment.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Tokyo for talks with Japanese officials, explained that Washington wants to promote democratic principles in Myanmar, as it does elsewhere.“We believe in democracy and human rights, the rule of law, because we’ve seen how our own countries are stronger, because we adhere to those values, and because they are under threat in may places, including in this region,” he said. “In Burma, the military is attempting to overturn the results of a democratic election and is brutally repressing peaceful protests.” The United States calls Myanmar by its old name, Burma, which was changed by a previous military regime.Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said after his bilateral meeting with Blinken that they shared “strong concern” over the situation in Myanmar, especially attacks on peaceful demonstrations.“There have been casualties among civilians, and we are strongly concerned about the development,” he said, adding that they demand Myanmar immediately release Suu Kyi and restore a democratic system.',\n",
              " \"CPN (Maoist Center) has decided to hold dialogue with Nepali Congress (NC) and Janata Samajwadi Party.The party's central committee meeting at Paris Danda on Monday has decided to hold dialogue with the two parties, according to CPN (Maoist Center) Spokesperson Narayan Kaji Shrestha. He added that the meeting has been adjourned for a few days.The meeting also decided to seek review of the SC verdict to invalidate its unification with CPN-UML and send leaders to provinces and districts for expansion of the party's organization.Shrestha said the party will take appropriate decision on its leaders who are in the Cabinet of Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli who were instructed to return to the party as they did not comply.The party's central committee meeting at Paris Danda on Saturday had instructed Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, Energy Minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Water Supply Minister Mani Thapa, Irrigation Minister Prabhu Sah, Sports Minister Dawa Lama and Labor Minister Gauri Shankar Chaudhary to immediately return to the party.The party had given 24 hours to its 23 leaders including the aforementioned ministers who were inducted as CPN-UML central members on Friday to furnish written response clarifying whether they have quit Maoist Center or not.But the leaders did not submit written response as instructed.\",\n",

The meeting was held at the party office after Nepal refused to meet Oli at the PM\\'s residence in Baluwatar.Oli spoke first in the meeting that also included other leaders of both the factions. A leader of the Khanal-Nepal faction told Setopati that Oli talked sweet at the beginning stressing on the need to move forward together but did not give up anything.Nepal spoke after that and claimed that his faction has always been for party unity, according to the leader, and demanded that the unilateral decision taken by Oli on March 12 be voided. Oli had held a central committee meeting of his faction and taken away responsibilities of leaders of the Khanal-Nepal faction on March 12.Nepal stressed that UML has been reinstated to the status before unification after the Supreme Court (SC) invalidated unification of the then CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the status of the day they were unified and pointed that the decision taken by the meeting of Oli faction on March 12 be voided.Ishwore Pokharel, Bishnu Paudel and Subash Chandra Nembang of the Oli faction also spoke during the meeting that continued for almost two hours.\"They did not agree when we asked for annulment of the decision taken by the meeting of March 12 as it was not legitimate,\" the leader of the Khanal-Nepal faction stated.Nepal urged Oli to cancel the tea party scheduled for Tuesday and the central committee meeting for Saturday while the Oli faction called for cancellation of the national gathering of leaders and cadres called by the Khanal-Nepal faction for Wednesday and Thursday.The Khanal-Nepal faction on Saturday had formed parallel committees after Oli unilaterally took away responsibilities of leaders of the faction.The faction had given responsibility of Province 1 to Bhim Acharya, Province 2 to Ghanashyam Bhusal, Bagmati to Ashta Laxmi Shakya, Gandaki to Surendra Pandey, Lumbini and Karnali to Yuva Raj Gyawali and Far West to Bhim Rawal.Similarly, Raghuji Panta had been made chief of the youth department, Gokarna Bista that of student department, Yogesh Bhattarai publicity, Shakya women and Pramesh Hamal intellectuals.',\n",

              " 'Myanmar’s security forces shot to death at least 10 people protesting the military’s coup Thursday, spurning a U.N. Security Council appeal to stop using lethal force and as an independent U.N. expert cited growing evidence of crimes against humanity.The military also lodged a new allegation against the deposed government leader Aung San Suu Kyi, alleging that in 2017-18 she was illegally given $600,000 and gold bars worth slightly less by a political ally. She and President Win Myint have been detained on less serious allegations and the new accusation was clearly aimed at discrediting Suu Kyi and perhaps charging her with a serious crime.Military spokesman Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun said at a news conference in the capital that former Yangon Division Chief Minister Phyo Min Thein had admitted giving the money and gold to Suu Kyi, but presented no evidence.Myanmar has been roiled by protests, strikes and other acts of civil disobedience since the coup toppled Suu Kyi’s government Feb. 1 just as it was to start its second term. The takeover reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.Local press reports and posts on social media on Thursday said there were six deaths in Myaing, a town in the central Magway Region, and one each in Yangon, Mandalay, Bago and Taungoo. In many cases, photos of what were said to be the bodies of the dead were posted online.Security forces have attacked previous protests with live ammunition as well, leading to the deaths of at least 60 people. They have also employed tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and stun grenades. Many demonstrators have been brutally beaten.On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously called for reversing the coup and strongly condemned the violence against peaceful protesters. It also called for “utmost restraint” by the military.An independent U.N. rights expert focusing on Myanmar told the the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council on Thursday that violence against protesters and even “people sitting peacefully in their homes” was rising. He said the junta was detaining dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people every day.Thomas Andrews, a former U.S. lawmaker, also pointed to growing evidence of crimes against humanity being committed by security forces, citing murder, enforced disappearance, persecution, torture and imprisonment against basic rules of international law. He acknowledged a formal determination requires a full investigation and trial. He is working under a mandate from the council and does not speak for the U.N.The human rights group Amnesty International on Thursday issued a report saying Myanmar’s military “is using increasingly lethal tactics and weapons normally seen on the battlefield against peaceful protesters and bystanders across the country.”The London-based group said its examination of more than 50 videos from the crackdown confirmed that “security forces appear to be implementing planned, systematic strategies including the ramped-up use of lethal force. Many of the killings documented amount to extrajudicial executions.”“These are not the actions of overwhelmed, individual officers making poor decisions. These are unrepentant commanders already implicated in crimes against humanity, deploying their troops and murderous methods in the open,” Joanne Mariner, its director of crisis response, said in a statement.As widespread street protests against the coup continue, the junta is facing a new challenge from the country’s ethnic guerrilla forces, which until recently had limited themselves to verbal denunciations of last month’s coup.Reports from Kachin, the northernmost state, said guerrilla forces from the Kachin ethnic minority attacked a government base on Thursday and were in turn attacked. The armed wing of the Kachin political movement is the Kachin Independence Army, or KIA.“This morning in Hpakant township, the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO/KIA) attacked a military council battalion based in Sezin village, and the KIO/KIA’s Hpakant-based 9th Brigade and 26 battalions were attacked by helicopter. Both sides are still investigating,” The 74 Media reported on Twitter.A Facebook page for the Kachin Liberation Media said the KIA had overrun the government outpost and seized ammunition. It warned the government against using lethal force to break up anti-coup protests in the Kachin capital, Myitkyina, where two demonstrators were killed this week.The reports could not be independently confirmed, and ethnic guerrilla armies as well as the government often release exaggerated information. However, even making such an announcement amounts to a sharp warning to the government.The Kachin actions come a few days after another ethnic guerrilla force belonging to the Karen minority announced it would protect demonstrators in territory it controlled. The Karen National Union deployed armed combatants to guard a protest in Myanmar’s southeastern Tanintharyi Region.Myanmar has more than a dozen ethnic guerrilla armies, mostly in border areas, a legacy of decades-old struggles for greater autonomy from the central government. Many have formal or informal cease-fire agreements with the government, but armed clashes still occur.There has been speculation that some ethnic groups could form a de facto alliance with the protest movement to pressure the government.',\n",

              " 'Myanmar security forces dramatically escalated their crackdown on protests against last month’s coup, killing at least 33 protesters Wednesday in several cities, according to accounts on social media and local news reports compiled by a data analyst.That is highest daily death toll since the Feb. 1 takeover, exceeding the 18 that the U.N. Human Rights Office said were killed on Sunday, and could galvanize the international community, which has responded fitfully thus far to the violence. Videos from Wednesday also showed security forces firing slingshots at demonstrators, chasing them down and even brutally beating an ambulance crew.The toll could even be higher; the Democratic Voice of Burma, an independent television and online news service, tallied 38 deaths.Demonstrators have regularly flooded the streets of cities across the country since the military seized power and ousted the elected government of leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Their numbers have remained high even as security forces have repeatedly fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds to disperse the crowds, and arrested protesters en masse.The intensifying standoff is unfortunately familiar in the country with a long history of peaceful resistance to military rule — and brutal crackdowns. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian nation after five decades of military rule.The Wednesday death toll was compiled by a data analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared for his safety. He also collected information where he could on the victims’ names, ages, hometowns, and where and how they were killed.The Associated Press was unable to independently confirm most of the reported deaths, but several square with online postings. The data analyst, who is in Yangon, the country’s biggest city, said he collected the information to honor those who were killed for their heroic resistance.According to his list, the highest number of deaths were in Yangon, where the total was 18. In the central city of Monywa, which has turned out huge crowds, eight were reported. Two deaths each were reported in Salin, a town in Magwe region, and in Mandalay, the country’s second-biggest city. Mawlamyine, in the country’s southeast, and Myingyan and Kalay, both in central Myanmar, each had a single death.As part of the crackdown, security forces have also arrested hundreds of people at protests, including journalists. On Saturday, at least eight journalists, including Thein Zaw of The Associated Press, were detained. A video shows he had moved out of the way as police charged down a street at protesters, but then was seized by police officers, who handcuffed him and held him briefly in a chokehold before marching him away.He has been charged with violating a public safety law that could see him imprisoned for up to three years.The escalation of the crackdown has led to increased diplomatic efforts to resolve Myanmar’s political crisis — but there appear to be few viable options. It’s not yet clear if Wednesday’s soaring death toll could change the dynamic.The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold a closed meeting on the situation on Friday, council diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized the give the information before the official announcement. The United Kingdom requested the meeting, they said.Still, any kind of coordinated action at the United Nations will be difficult since two permanent members of the Security Council, China and Russia, would almost certainly veto it. Some countries have imposed or are considering imposing their own sanctions.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, held a teleconference meeting of foreign ministers on Tuesday to discuss the crisis.But there, too, action is unlikely. The regional group of 10 nations has a tradition of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs. A statement by the chair after the meeting merely called for an end to violence and for talks on how to reach a peaceful settlement.Ignoring that appeal, Myanmar’s security forces on Wednesday continued to attack peaceful protesters.In addition to the deaths, there have been reports of other violence. In Yangon, a widely circulated video taken from a security camera showed police in the city brutally beating members of an ambulance crew — apparently after they were arrested. Police can be seen kicking the three crew members and thrashing them with rifle butts.Security forces are believed to single out medical workers for arrest and mistreatment because members of the medical profession launched the country’s civil disobedience movement to resist the junta.In Mandalay, riot police, backed by soldiers, broke up a rally and chased around 1,000 teachers and students from a street with tear gas as gun shots could be heard.Video from the AP showed a squad of police firing slingshots in the apparent direction of demonstrators as they dispersed.',\n",

A second shooting death was reported later on social media.Live fire also was reported to have caused injuries in Magwe, also in central Myanmar; in the town of Hpakant in the northern state of Kachin; and in Pyinoolwin, a town in central Myanmar better known to many by its British colonial name, Maymyo.The usual daily protests in Yangon, the country’s largest city, were met with tear gas and rubber bullets but no confirmed accounts of deaths there emerged Wednesday.However, a widely circulated video taken from a security camera showed police in Yangon brutally beating members of an ambulance crew — apparently after they were arrested.Police kick the three crew members and thrashed them with rifle butts.
